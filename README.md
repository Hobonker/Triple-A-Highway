# Waymo Car

## introduction // motivation

for this hackathon we wanted to make a project that resonated with the San Francisco culture, while still making something that looks cool and does something functional. now while we seriously fumbled on the apperances portion of the project (mainly due to our lack of access to 3d printers), I think we were still able to make a project that fits the goals we set out with. our initial goal was to create a sphero-type robot that would use some implementation of obstcable avoidance to avoid walls and move irregularly to ultimately form a complex pong game. however, after much revision, we eventually settled on making a miniature waymo car, that would have object avoidance- specifically, it would automatically steer away from obstacales it would detect using the ultrasonic sensor.
